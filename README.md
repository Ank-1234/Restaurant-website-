Web Technologies used: HTML, CSS
IDE: VS-Code
Title: Restaurant website 
Used bootstrap tools & own styles.

Implemented responsive template.

Working:
The complete data is getting requested from firebase Realtime database, the components use that data to display the results, the components in menu, offers and other sections can then directly be modified by simply modifying the data in database, for example if the price of something changes or the image of some dish changes you don't have to modify the code, simply make the change in databse and it will be reflected on the website.
